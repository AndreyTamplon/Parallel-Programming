# Evaluation of the efficiency of parallelization of matrix multiplication depending on the lattice topology

1. Parallel algorithm for multiplying a matrix by a matrix with a 2D lattice is implemented.
2. The performance of a parallel program is investigated depending on the size of the matrix and the size of the lattice.

| Lattice | Time    |
| ------- | ------- |
| 2 x 12  | 31,3342 |
| 3 x 8   | 30,916  |
| 4 x 6   | 30,8809 |
| 6 x 4   | 30,88   |
| 8 x 3   | 30,934  |
| 12 x 2  | 31,154  |
