# Fixed-point iteration method

1. 3 programs (one sequential and 2 parallel) in C or C++, which implement an iterative algorithm for solving a system of linear algebraic equations of the form Ax=b. Here A is a matrix of size NÃ—N, x and b are vectors of length N. The type of elements is double.
2. 2 parallel programs are implemented using MPI with cutting the matrix A by rows (in the first program) or by columns (in the second) into parts that are close in size, possibly not the same. Program 1: Vectors x and b are duplicated in each MPI process, Program 2: vectors x and b are split between MPI processes.
3. The operation time of the serial version of the program and 2 parallel ones was measured when using a different number of processor cores. (2, 4, 8, 16, 24).
